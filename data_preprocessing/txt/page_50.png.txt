The Positive Cycle of Dialogue and Enhancing Corporate Value
ITOCHU emphasizes dialogue with its shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders from the perspective of 
achieving sustainable growth and enhancing corporate value over the medium to long term. After announcing 
“Brand-new Deal 2020,” which failed to give due consideration to market expectations, the Company’s share 
price plunged. Learning from this experience, we now strive to reflect input obtained in investor meetings, 
general meetings of shareholders, and one-on-one meetings into our management strategies and financial 
and capital policies. Through commitment-based management, we are striving to expand corporate value 
and sustain a positive cycle through effective engagement.
