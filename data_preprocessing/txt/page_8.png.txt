Driving Force for Sustainable Value Creation
We continue to hone the driving force for value creation, 
which flows through the values and corporate culture we 
have upheld over more than 160 years, as we strive to 
sustainably enhance corporate value.
POINTS
Distinctive “Inherited Strengths”  
as a Merchant
▶ Page 20
We have cultivated our distinctive 
strengths as a merchant over the 
years, including “individual capabili-
ties,” “earning power in the non- 
resource sector,” “experience and 
track record in China and other parts 
of Asia,” and “comprehensive strength 
and ability of self-transformation.”
Pursuing “All the Priorities,”  
not just “a Single Expedient”
▶ Page 30
Through ongoing management that 
remains cautious of trust and credit-
worthiness based on “Sampo-yoshi,” 
we will enhance interaction between 
internal and external capital and strive 
to enhance sustainable corporate 
value.
Centering on the unwavering ideal 
“Sampo-yoshi,” rather than seeking 
to achieve either short-term targets 
or the medium- to long-term vision, 
or either economic or social value, 
we aim to pursue “all the priorities.”

Cautious of Trust and 
Creditworthiness

Achievement of Short-Term Targets
Through “commitment-based management,” we remain 
intent on steadily achieving our targets for each fiscal 
year. We believe this is important for gaining the support 
of stakeholders regarding the feasibility of our medium- to 
long-term management strategy.

We exceeded the level of consoli-
dated net profit we had committed 
to in our plan at the start of the fiscal 
year, surpassing ¥500.0 billion for the 
second consecutive year and achiev-
ing a new record high. Core Operating 
Cash Flows and NET DER also 
marked new records.
Based on our “Brand-new Deal” 
strategy, which commenced with 
“Brand-new Deal 2012,” we have 
elicited our strengths and taken 
steady steps to enhance corporate 
value.

Although the future business environ-
ment is difficult to forecast accurately, 
we will consolidate our foothold by 
thoroughly instilling the “earn, cut, 
prevent” principles, simultaneously 
putting in place the foundations for 
the post-COVID-19 world.
