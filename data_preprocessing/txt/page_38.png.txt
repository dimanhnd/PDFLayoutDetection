Macroenvironmental PEST Analysis
The business environment surrounding ITOCHU is changing day by day, while uncertainties increase. Through a 
PEST analysis, we adequately assess the risks and opportunities related to non-financial capital in the context 
of macroeconomic factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and trade friction between the United States and 
China. We use this assessment to build a stronger competitive edge while flexibly responding and adapting to 
changes in the business environment.
