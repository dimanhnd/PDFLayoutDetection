Our Business Model, as Seen through Business Development
Expanding Our Multifaceted Businesses and 
Tirelessly Upgrading
We are expanding our multifaceted businesses through a chain reaction by leveraging functional areas of 
strength. At the same time, we are combining existing businesses, shifting to a market-oriented perspective, and 
investing in new fields. Through such efforts, we continue to upgrade our business model and pursue a new 
vision of what a trading company can achieve.
