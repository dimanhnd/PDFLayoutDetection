Sustainable Value Creation through Capital Accumulation
The ITOCHU Group conducts its business through both trade and business investment. In the course of its 
history over 160 years, we have steadily accumulated internal capital such as human capital and business 
know-how. 
  Meanwhile, we believe that trust and creditworthiness are extremely important for achieving enhancement of 
interaction between internal and external capital. By always remaining cautious of trust and creditworthiness in 
our management practice, we aim to realize increases in economic and social value, and to continuously expand 
our corporate value.
