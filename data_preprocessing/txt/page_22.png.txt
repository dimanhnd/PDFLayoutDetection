Driving Force for Sustainable Value Creation
The Story of Merchants
More than 160 years have passed since ITOCHU’s establishment in 1858. Like our founder, Chubei Itoh I, 
who crossed rugged mountain passes and paved the ways for peddling his wares throughout Japan, we have 
overcome numerous difficulties during the ensuing years. Despite these difficulties we have remained true 
to our identity as a merchant, “supplying the needs of the society,” as well as to the business philosophy of 
Chubei Itoh I, “Sampo-yoshi.” This identity and philosophy have constantly underscored our actions and 
served as the driving force for transforming ourselves.
